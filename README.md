# Worm-City
a text-based adventure rpg, like pokemon in its combat system but with a cool scifi twist to it's story and setting.
to-do:
1. find out how github pages works and how I can use it to host the game

2. start planning how the stats within the game are going to work
3. draw up how the UI is going to look

4. create the basic plan for the story (equilibrium, disruption, recognition of disruption, resolution, return to equilibrium). Remember that this game starts with the alien possession so that CAN'T be the disruption - I'm thinking over aliens come to the planet or something. 

5. now that I have the story structure, create a massive list of all the characters and the catch-able people - their stats and abilities (remember "dirty weeb" low physical dfs and atk and low emotional dfs and 

6. write out the story in detail including all the different otions, the dialogue, place descriptions etc (once I actually start coding and putting the full thing together, I can come back and add things I missed) (use a lot of flow charts to help you keep track of the branching storylines and dialogue options. Also write descriptions for all the locations; Home, north district (poor), south district (rich boi), beach side(east) and forrest(west) and all the small areas within those larger areas.

7. learn how you're going to actually code the game

8. draw the art - art for each character, catch-able, location, item and anything else you might think of. it should look 16-bit ish with minimal colours - like black and white with specific high-lights or somethings (character smiling all black and white but her cheeks are blushing pink just to look EXTRA cute - sommin like that.)

9. compose the music. sombre chiptune music - use beepbox. If for whatever reason you can't use beepbox then just fuck around with deathgrips songs in audacity but I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS it will sound shit and be gay. need a menu song (slow paced sparced, kinda dull) need a song for each area that matches it's tone, need a fight song, need a 'you dead' sound (don't think of dark souls like I know you are - think retro like a bunch of beeps or something. Go here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_uZ1-p20hA for inspiration) need themes for each major character that fits their personality and place in the story, need a 'saving game' jingle, need a hit noise and anything else you can think of (take your time, you have a whole year to do this (needs to be out or atleast mostly done by 2020 or kys)

10. Finally code the game.
